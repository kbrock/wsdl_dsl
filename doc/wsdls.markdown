soap

Jave backend (Axis, XFire, Spring, Hibernate)


# wordy

TODO: image of wsdl and code needed to alter 1 attribute

- boiler plate code
- change requires edits in many places
- need expensive editing tool (XMLSpy)

# lack of standards (IMG: square hole, round peg)

- library doesn't understand some WSDL constructs
	- flash, salesforce don't do xsds (IMG)
	- XFire doesn't do groups (IMG)
	- .net didn't do qualified attributes, next version did (IMG)
- libraries internally not consistent. (XFire client can't speak with XFire server)
- libraries can't speak with other libraries
- different versions of same library can't speak with each other (.net)
- too many java versions of libraries

# Ph.D. in SOAP

- stay up with the times
- just like cross browser javascript
- libraries help the javascript
- (I don't want a Ph.D. in WSDL)

# DSL to the rescue

- fewer words
- concentrate on domain (structs, methods, enums)
- tool has SOAP knowledge
	- don't have to remember
	- less work
		- can tweak one and others are updated
		- don't have to document / teach all the ins and outs

# demo

- wsdl, xsd
- inline wsdl
- pictures (dot)
- picture .jpg
- html document
- java code (in .zip)
