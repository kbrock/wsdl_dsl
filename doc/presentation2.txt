hello

My name is keenan brock
I'd like to introduce to you a project I just revived
it is called interfaces
and it is all about agile soap

my team was developing a web service
they wanted to use soap
so I put together the start of a person record
we met
we changed the attributes
I changed the soap
we met again
we changed the attributes
I changed the soap

I suggested we use diagrams for our meetings
but being coders
they wanted the diagrams
they were easier to use
but they also wanted to see the soap (WSDL)

we kept meeting
things kept changing
and changing
and changing

soap is verbose
it is not agile
it is hard to change
we would think we got a good solution
but after using the interface
they suggested more changes
and being soap
those changes took time

And this was not just basic soap
sure it was written in java
but the clients were in microsoft crm, salesforce.com, java, and flex
and they don't talk to each other
even though soap strives to be universal
it isn't
we developed a checklist of constraints
that helps the soap become universal

so i did what every developer does
I wrote code in one technology that I like
so that I didn't have to working with a difficult technology (soap) that wasn't so nice

and so I didn't have to remember the checklist of constraints
that would allow ll these technologies to work together
that would help
